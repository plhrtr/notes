# Notes

An app where you can persistently store all your notes.
The twist, each note remembers where you took it!

Your notes are ordered by the distance from where you took them to your current
location.
If you are in the university, your notes from there are at top; at home the
ones you took there, and so on.

So take notes and forget about them, till the moment you revisit the location.

Have fun!
